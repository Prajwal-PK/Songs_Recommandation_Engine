# Song Recommendation Engine

Ever wondered how music streaming platforms suggest songs you might love?

This project is a machine learning-based recommendation engine that predicts and recommends songs similar to the ones you already enjoy. Using a Random Forest Regressor, it analyzes song features to suggest tracks that match your musical taste.

### Features Used:

* Acousticness
* Danceability
* Energy
* Instrumentalness
* Liveness
* Loudness
* Speechiness
* Tempo
* Valence

### ML Model:
This project uses several machine learning algorithms to predict song popularity and provide recommendations:

* Linear Regression
* Support Vector Regression (SVR)
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* K-Means Clustering
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest


### Deployment:
The model is deployed using Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface for selecting songs and getting recommendations.
